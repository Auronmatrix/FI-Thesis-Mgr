\chapter{Crossvertise Case Study}
This chapter introduces the Crossvertise Platform as the research case study in order to illustrate the application of multi-tenancy to a real world SaaS application as example. It aims to define a concrete set of design inputs and requirements combined with the current context of the Crossvertise SaaS platform and attempts to use it as premise for architecting our multi-tenant model. 

\section{Crossvertise GmbH}
Crossvertise GmbH henceforth "XV", is a Munich based SaaS provider and startup. Their core domain of business consists of the entirety of the advertising market. The company has developed their own online, cross-media marketplace platform which is offered as SaaS solution to large advertising houses and corporations. Their platform is also the back end of their own  market.crossvertise.com website which allows publishers, advertisers and companies to run cross-media marketing campaigns by booking advertising media online.

The Crossvertise platform (XV-Platform) integrates over 80\% of Germany's advertising and publishing data to enable its users to book mobile, online, cinema, television, radio or out-of-home advertising easily and effortlessly online. 

\section{XV Platform Background}
The current XV-Platform was initially developed as back end to run the companies own media marketplace eCommerce website. However, as time progressed it became apparent that the platform could be a powerful service to be delivered through the public cloud as a SaaS solution for companies that are in the same business domain. Due to this duality in function the platform currently only reached SaaS maturity level 1 (ad-hoc) \cite{Chong2006} in the sense that a single, completely customised instance of the platform is hosted for each of the platforms tenants. Since tenants are large advertising companies and have very specific requirements pertaining to the media and mediums which should be provided by their application instance, it has been hard to be able to migrate the service to a higher maturity level. However, recently an active effort has been made by the development team to migrate customisation away from code and into configuration in order to achieve SaaS maturity level 2.

At time of writing Crossvertise was running 12 instances of their XV platform on Windows Azure Web Roles. Figure \ref{fig:xv_azure_arc} outlines the basic Azure architecture used by the current platform. Two instances to serve their main website (market.crossvertise.com) and 10 instances each serving their individual tenants. Running 12 instances of the same platform however is quite costly and has led to the requirement of looking into developing a feasible alternative. The high amount of hosted application instances also contributed to maintenance and administration overhead which could be simplified by a multi-tenant alternative. Finally, the current application persistence model lacks tenant isolation and therefore is a strong candidate for improvement. All of these factors have lead to the requirement of moving the current platform to a completely scalable, multi-tenant-efficient SaaS solution that meets the criteria of maturity level 4, reduces costs and simplifies tenant provisioning, customisation and maintenance. 

\section{Technical Specifications}
As a startup company, Crossvertise has subscribed to Microsoft's BizSpark program which helps startups engage in software development by providing them with open access to many of Microsoft's technologies and tools \cite{BizSpark}. This has allowed the company to gain access to the public cloud through Microsoft Azure and develop its platform using Visual Studio, C\# and ASP.NET MVC. Access to these resources have been the primary decisive factor in choices of technologies used in the platform and the current IT team has been structured largely around these Microsoft technologies. It is for these reasons that this research paper has continued to use technologies and tools that align with this strategy, however in cases where newer technologies have become available they have been taken into consideration.

\end{figure}

A more precise breakdown of platform technologies can be seen in figure \ref{fig:xv_tech_breakdown}.The Crossvertise platform was designed using the Microsofts ASP.Net Framework. It utilizes the Model, View Controller (MVC) architectural pattern for the program design and the open source Entity Framework for Object Relational Mapping (ORM) to a collection Microsoft SQL databases. Currently the platform is hosted using Microsoft Azure Cloud Services. Website is hosted on  on Microsoft's Internet Information Services (IIS) installed on an Azure Web Role virtual machine. In conjunction with the Web Role the platform uses an helper application running on an Azure Worker Role virtual machine to conduct database, email and other operational tasks. The team uses TeamCity build server for continuous integration and testing and Git and GitHub for source control. Data is persisted to two different Azure SQL Databases, firstly is the marketplace DB which stores all of the platforms e-Commerce transaction and user data and the media DB which stores all of the media specific data such as availability, pricing, form factors and publishers. The media DB is quite large (11GB) and is updated every night through the integration of different advertising data outlets and sources. The application stores large binary objects such as videos, images and sounds for the platform using Azure Blob storage and uses Azure Cache in order to improve performance. Crossvertise currently does not utilise any third party components that would restrict the implementation of a multi-tenant architecture.
 The majority of code of the XV platform was written using C\# (66.3\%)  but also includes JavaScript (31.4\%) and CSS (2.1\%) for front end design. 

The platform solution consists of 11 projects (see figure \ref{fig:xv_proj_arc}). The Xv.Marketplace.MVC project includes all MVC code, this includes ViewModels, Views and Controllers. Although conventional MVC uses Models directly within the MVC application, the Models for the application have been extracted into the Xv.Marketplace.Domain project. The models are presented using POCO classes combined with Data Annotations that provide the models metadata. The Business Logic project acts as a service layer and as the name suggest is responsible for all the business logic applied when objects are retrieved from the repositories. The Xv.Marketplace.Worker project is used to complete functional tasks that is not handled by the MVC project such as sending of emails, reminders, cleaning up of storage and indexing. The Repositories project is responsible for communicating with the Microsoft SQL database and uses Entity Framework to map objects to an relational database structure and vise-versa. The repositories are mostly concerned with CRUD operations of entities but also handle security. Finally, the Infrastructure project is used for cross cutting concerns and utilities. This includes resources used in the different projects, helper, wrapper and extension classes. All of the Test projects include either Unit tests for their corresponding projects or in the case of the Repositories Test project, integration tests.

\section{XV-Platform persistence}
As the XV-Platform is the core of the Crossvertise business model the exact information regarding the applications database schemas are subject to nondisclosure. In order to provide context for the case study the core tables and relationships in the marketplace DB have been extracted and can be seen in the appendix. The entity relational diagram highlights some important points about the schema used in the current platform. Firstly, there is an extreme degree of denormalization used in many of the tables, this has been done in order to improve performance by grouping frequently access data together. Secondly, a lot of multi-directional relationships have developed between the entities as the schema has evolved over time. These relationships are currently a problem as entities can be accessed through multiple roots entities and the current platform does not support lazy loading. This causes multiple calls to the database in order to obtain basic child objects. This greatly influences the current persistence performance. 



\section{Business Requirements}
In addition to the basic technical design requirements, the core business requirement for shifting to a multi-tenant model is reduction of costs. The business model also requires specific provisioning of new tenants/platform customers to be streamlined and simplified in order to reduce the amount of developer time required for setting up, customising and deploying new instances for new tenants. At the current state, provisioning of a new platform customer is a long manual process within which the XV platform is manipulated and customised according to the clients specific needs. This proved to be an extremely time consuming, expensive and resource heavy process. Therefore, one of the fundamental business requirements multi-tenant system includes high levels of customisation with low provisioning costs. 

\section{Conclusion}
Throughout this paper we discuss and articulate means of which to overcome the design requirements defined by this case study. The major requirements including migrating from a SaaS maturity level 1 to a SaaS maturity level 4 implementation. Decreasing overall costs through resource sharing and simplification of the tenant provisioning process. The technological restrictions include using Windows Azure and ASP.NET MVC.
