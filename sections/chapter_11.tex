\section{Regarding the Research Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item What broadview generic application architecture can be used to implement an multi-tenant applications for a variety of cloud platforms?
\item What are the currently available technologies provided by Windows Azure to create architect and implement an multi-tenant solution?
\item Which Azure Specific multi-tenant architecture can be implemented as prototype \index{Prototype} artefact to solve the major requirements for our case study?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Research Assumptions, Limitations and Delimitation}

\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Microsoft Azure is a publically available cloud platform
\item The high level architectural design concepts produced are generalizable to other cloud providers and technologies with refinement and alteration
\end{itemize}

\index{Multi-tenant}
\subsection{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
\item The results of this study is very technology dependent and therefore cannot be completely generalized for SaaS providers using any platform. It only serves as foundation for understanding how a multi-tenant system can be implemented in Azure and should be used for gaining context. In order to address this limitation, an high level general architecture has been extracted from the results
\item The prototype produced in this study is aimed only as acting as proof of concept for the architectural design discussed in this research paper and does not aim to be a complete implementation of our case study application. It should mimic some fundamental functionality of the case study application only to show suggested means of implementing the different concepts of the architecture. Furthermore, the prototype has a few critical limitations discussed in the final chapter concerning hosting due to the high costs of using the services that the actual case study application would require
\item It is therefore important to note that the prototype created as part of this paper does not aim to provide specific implementation details or showcase specific design patterns or approaches. It also does not attempt to be a fully fledged system intended for future extension into an actual SaaS service but only exists as means of evaluating the architectural viability
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Delimitations}
\begin{itemize}
\item This research paper does not aim to implement a fully fledged e-Commerce application for the purpose of selling advertising media. Instead, it uses this domain as context for designing an architecture that could be used to build such a system
\item Technological delimitations are made in relation to the case study and includes the usage of Microsoft Azure, ASP.NET \index{ASP.NET} MVC and C\# for building the application
