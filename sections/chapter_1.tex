\chapter{Introduction}
The advent of cloud computing has changed the way we look at Service Science (SS). With the rapidly declining cost of Infrastructure, Platform and Software as a Service offerings and the increased potential of cloud technologies many are moving away from a classic self hosting Infrastructure to a cloud alternative. One of the biggest advantages that cloud computing provides potentially limitless vertical scalability. As a result, software engineers and computer architects have needed to change the way they design and implement their software and systems. This meant stepping back from a single instance, single-tenant model and considering utilizing the advantages the cloud has provided by means of multi-tenancy.
 
This study focuses on first understanding what multi-tenancy is and why it is relevant to the design of cloud based solutions. A case study is used to provide a relevant context to the research from which design considerations are drawn and finally a theoretical architecture implementing multi-tenancy for the specific case requirements is derived.

\section{An Analogy for Multi-tenancy}
A common analogy for multi-tenancy can be made by comparing multi-tenant software systems with an apartment block. Software tenants are considered a closed group of customers that are handled together and usually share a common view of the system \cite{Krebs2012} \cite{Wilder}. This means that like in the apartment block, tenants are a grouping of customers (people/families/businesses) using the system (living in an apartment). In such an apartment block, a tenant is an owner of their own respective apartment. Each tenant lives and operates within their apartment independently of other tenants. The tenant could also have other people living or working in his apartment while being completely isolated from the apartment block and other tenants as a whole. Although each tenant lives and acts as if they own the entirety of their apartment block, they are actually sharing resources with all the other tenants including, electricity, heating and property space. In contrast to an apartment block (multi-tenant). Classical software systems represent a house), where only a single-tenant lives and all resources are consumed and used by that tenant. Building a house for each family (grouping of customers or tenant) is extremely expensive and in many cases simply not feasible especially since everyone wants to pay the minimum amount of money for a place to live.
