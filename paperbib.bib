abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between the practices of agile software development and usability engineering, and examines how these practices may be integrated within a single methodology. As agile methods have become increasingly popular, they have begun to replace structured approaches to software engineering. Usability engineering has historically tended to follow a development approach that is similar to traditional software engineering, rendering it apparently incompatible with agile methods. The focus of this paper is an analysis of the relationship between agile practices, on the one hand, and current practices of usability engineering on the other. We provide an experience report from an organisation where usability engineering has been integrated into an agile software development method. From this context we identify areas of compatibility and also areas of conflict, and suggest some strategies for agile development teams to incorporate key practices from usability engineering, while at the same time suggesting that usability engineers should embrace relevant agile techniques.},

abstract = {The methods section of a research paper provides the information by which a study's validity is judged. Therefore, it requires a clear and precise description of how an experiment was done, and the rationale for why specific experimental procedures were chosen. The methods section should describe what was done to answer the research question, describe how it was done, justify the experimental design, and explain how the results were analyzed. Scientific writing is direct and orderly. Therefore, the methods section structure should: describe the materials used in the study, explain how the materials were prepared for the study, describe the research protocol, explain how measurements were made and what calculations were performed, and state which statistical tests were done to analyze the data. Once all elements of the methods section are written, subsequent drafts should focus on how to present those elements as clearly and logically as possibly. The description of preparations, measurements, and the protocol should be organized chronologically. For clarity, when a large amount of detail must be presented, information should be presented in sub-sections according to topic. Material in each section should be organized by topic from most to least important.},

abstract = {Design research is a fast-growing field of inquiry with significant importance in terms of helping society to create products and processes of improved quality and for enhancing the environment in which we live. The step-wise, hands-on approach of DRM studies the ways in which design research can best be undertaken to address specific questions. This study gives rise, for the first time, to a generic and systematic design research methodology intended to improve the quality of design research - its academic credibility, industrial significance and societal contribution - by enabling more thorough, efficient and effective procedures.Professors Blessing and Chakrabarti provide a comprehensive list of types of design research linked to appropriate research methods - familiar as well as new - and supported by illustrative examples throughout the text. Furthermore, the book points the way to more detailed sources of various established research methods that can be applied. The practical emphasis of the text is reinforced by a whole section of design research project examples contributed by eminent design researchers and placed in the context of the proposed methodology to demonstrate the application of the variety of approaches available in a structured fashion.DRM, a Design Research Methodology, speaks to a broad readership: it will provide the graduate student with an excellent grounding in good design research practice, inculcating good habits of research for the future and showing how the process of understanding and improving design can become more effective and efficient; it will interest the academic and industrial researcher as a source of useful and well-ordered methods within a common design research ethos, as well as a methodological framework for research projects and programmes; it will attract the supervisors of young researchers by offering research methods and a well-thought-out and logically structured research process for use in courses on design research.},

abstract = {The Azure Services Platform is a brand-new cloud-computing technology from Microsoft. It is composed of four core components-Windows Azure, .NET Services, SQL Services, and Live Services-each with a unique role in the functioning of your cloud service. It is the goal of this book to show you how to use these components, both separately and together, to build flawless cloud services. At its heartWindows Azure Platformis a down-to-earth, code-centric book. This book aims to show you precisely how the components are employed and to demonstrate the techniques and best practices you need to know to use them to best effect. That said, authorTejaswi Redkarregularly takes time out to provide a thorough overview of the architectural concepts that underpin Windows Azure. Without this understanding, you will find it hard to use the platform to its full potential. By the time you''ve read this book, you will be comfortable building high-quality end-to-end Azure services of your own. What you''ll learn Know everything you need to about the Azure Services components-from Access Control to SQL Services, from the Service Bus to Workflow Services Understand both the architectural thinking behind Azure and the nuts-and-bolts code that binds your service together Design, build, and deploy an Azure service with the assistance of a fully worked template for end-to-end application design that mimics a real-world scenario and gives you a rock-solid example of the design and development processes that you need to work through Who this book is for This book is intended for professional developers who want to dig into the internals of Azure and start investigating its features in depth and adopting them into their workflow systems.

NoSQL technologies are well-suited for many new applications where traditional RDBMSes often don't perform or scale well - including systems requiring large-scale indexing, serving pages on high-traffic websites, and heavy-duty streaming media delivery. In NoSQL Distilled, renowned software expert Martin Fowler and Thoughtworks database consultant Pramod J. Sadalage demystify NoSQL, succinctly explore the architectural and design issues associated with implementing it, and offer realistic use cases. Modeled after UML Distilled Fowler's international best-seller, NoSQL Distilled, covers all this and more: * *Evaluating which enterprise applications NoSQL is (and isn't) appropriate for. *Understanding the architectural tradeoffs associated with deploying NoSQL. *Comparing leading NoSQL offerings such as MongoDB, CouchDB, Cassandra, Riak, and Neo4J. *Integrating NoSQL with legacy systems. *Managing performance, reliability, availability, and recoverability. *Overcoming widespread misconceptions about NoSQL and its tradeoffs. *Understanding how NoSQL can support the transition to cloud-based systems. *Using NoSQL in agile development environments. *Applying NoSQL in search/retrieval, metadata management, text analysis, social networking, business intelligence, and financial services applications. *Understanding NoSQL query languages, including Object Query MDX, and XQuery and more},

abstract = {Capturing a wealth of experience about the design of object-oriented software, four top-notch designers present a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to commonly occurring design problems. Previously undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves. The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently. Each pattern describes the circumstances in which it is applicable, when it can be applied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of using the pattern within a larger design. All patterns are compiled from real systems and are based on real-world examples. Each pattern also includes code that demonstrates how it may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk. 0201633612B07092001},

abstract = {Research in IT must address the design tasks faced by practitioners. Real problems must be properly conceptualized and represented, appropriate techniques for their solution must be constructed, and solutions must be implemented and evaluated using appropriate criteria. If significant progress is to be made, IT research must also develop an understanding of how and why IT systems work or do not work. Such an understanding must tie together natural laws governing IT systems with natural laws governing the environments in which they operate. This paper presents a two dimensional framework for research in information technology. The first dimension is based on broad types of design and natural science research activities: build, evaluate, theorize, and justify. The second dimension is based on broad types of outputs produced by design research: representational constructs, models, methods, and instantiations. We argue that both design science and natural science activities are needed to insure that IT research is both relevant and effective. ?? 1995 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper defines an information system design theory (ISDT) to be a prescriptive theory which integrates normative and descriptive theories into design paths intended to produce more effective information systems. The nature of ISDTs is articulated using Dubin's concept of theory building and Simon's idea of a science of the artificial. An example of an ISDT is presented in the context of Executive Information Systems (EIS). Despite the increasing awareness of the potential of EIS for enhancing executive strategic decision-making effectiveness, there exists little theoretical work which directly guides EIS design. We contend that the underlying theoretical basis of EIS can be addressed through a design theory of vigilant information systems. Vigilance denotes the ability of an information system to help an executive remain alertly watchful for weak signals and discontinuities in the organizational environment relevant to emerging strategic threats and opportunities. Research on managerial information scanning and emerging issue tracking as well as theories of open loop control are synthesized to generate vigilant information system design theory propositions. Transformation of the propositions into testable empirical hypotheses is discussed.},

abstract = {In most commercial electronic contract management applications available today, different customized code base has to be developed, deployed and operated to support each tenant. Few advanced commercial electronic contract management applications use a single code base with configuration options to support multi-tenants. However, a separate instance of the code base still has to be deployed and operated for each tenant even in these applications. The business model of having to support a single application instance for each tenant makes an electronic contract management application and other critical business applications out of reach for most small and medium businesses (SMBs), in particular, the very small businesses (SVBs) because of its high development and maintenance cost. Recently, a new business model of a single application instance supporting multi-tenancy based on software as a service (SaaS) has emerged making expensive business applications more affordable for SMBs and SVBs for multi-tenancy [1]. In this paper, we present the first of a kind multi-tenancy SaaS electronic contract management application. We also describe several novel methods used in the metadata, security and shared services, as well as customization and tenant extensions modules to support multi-tenancy SaaS in this application. This multi-tenancy SaaS application has shown to benefit both the application service providers as well as their tenants. This new multi-tenancy SaaS model can reduce the application hosting cost and make the application more affordable to the tenants because of its capabilities in customization and scalability while continuing to support an increasing number of tenants. It furthers benefits tenants by saving their money and time with immediate access to the latest IT innovations and infrastructure improvements on a single application code base. Most end users of tenants have found their productivities increased, the contract transaction time accelerated, contra-

abstract = {This paper analyzes scientific aspects of Computer Science. First it defines science and scientific method in general. It gives a discussion of relations between science, research, development and technology. The existing theory of science (Popper, Carnap, Kuhn, Chalmers) has physics as an ideal. Not many sciences come close to that ideal. Philosophy of Science (Theory of Science) as it is today is not of much help when trying to analyze Computer Science. Computer Science is a new field and its object of investigation (universe) is a computer, which is an ever-developing artifact, the materialization of the ideas that try to structure knowledge and the information about the world, including computers themselves. However different, Computer Science has its basis in logic and mathematics, and both theoretical and experimental research methods follow patterns of classical scientific fields. Computer modeling and simulation as a method is specific for the discipline, and it is going to develop even more in the future, not only applied to computers, but also to other scientific as well as commercial and artistic fields},

@book{Fowler2004,
abstract = {Now widely adopted as the de facto industry standard and sanctioned by the Object Management Group, the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a notation all software developers need to know and understand. However, the UML is a big language, and not all of it is equally important. The award-winning first edition of UML Distilled was widely praised for being a concise guide to the core parts of the UML and has proved extremely successful in helping developers get up and running quickly. UML Distilled, Second Edition, maintains the concise format with significantly updated coverage of use cases and activity diagrams, and expanded coverage of collaborations. It also includes a new appendix detailing the changes between UML versions.Written for those with a basic understanding of object-oriented analysis and design, this book begins with a summary of UML's history, development, and rationale and then moves into a discussion of how the UML can be integrated into the object-oriented development process. The primary author profiles the various modeling techniques in the UML--such as use cases, class diagrams, and interaction diagrams--and describes the notation and semantics clearly and succinctly. He also outlines useful non-UML techniques such as CRC cards and patterns. These descriptions are made even more relevant with a collection of best practices based on the primary author's experience and a brief Java programming example demonstrating the implementation of a UML-based design. With this tour of the key parts of the UML, readers will be left with a firm foundation upon which to build models and develop further knowledge of the Unified Modeling Language.Praise for the First Edition"UML Distilled is a recipient of the prestigious 1997 Software Development Magazine Productivity Award in the Books category. Addison-Wesley congratulates authors Martin Fowler and Kendall Scott for their outstanding work.""UML Distilled is well written, knowledgeable about both systems development and UML, and disarmingly honest." -- Robert L.

As multi-tenancy is a new concept, a common definition of the word and related concepts is not yet established and the architectural concerns are not fully understood. This paper provides an overview of important architectural concerns and there mutual influences. Beside that, it defines multi-tenancy and differentiates it from several related concepts.},

@inproceedings{Factor2013,
abstract = {Storage cloud systems achieve economies of scale by serving multiple tenants from a shared pool of servers and disks. This leads to the commingling of data from different tenants on the same devices. Typically, a request is processed by an application running with sufficient privileges to access any tenant's data; this application authenticates the user and authorizes the request prior to carrying it out. Since the only protection is at the application level, a single vulnerability threatens the data of all tenants, and could lead to cross-tenant data leakage, making the cloud much less secure than dedicated physical resources. To provide security close to physical isolation while allowing complete resource pooling, we propose Secure Logical Isolation for Multi-tenancy (SLIM). SLIM incorporates the first complete security model and set of principles for the safe logical isolation between tenant resources in a cloud storage system, as well as a set of mechanisms for implementing the model. We show how to implement SLIM for OpenStack Swift and present initial performance results.},

@article{Hevner2004,
abstract = {Two paradigms characterize much of the research in the Information Systems discipline: behavioral science and design science. The behavioral science paradigm seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of people, organizations, and technology. Our objective is to describe the performance of design-science research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research. In the design-science paradigm, knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its solution are achieved in the building and application of the designed artifact. Three recent exemplars in the research literature are used to demonstrate the application of these guidelines. We conclude with an analysis of the challenges of performing high-quality design-science research in the context of the broader IS community.},
